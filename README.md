# Check-in App

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9826ae19-5246-4664-a276-739569731f08/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/serene-shirley-df39f3/deploys)

Check-in app is a small tool to help keep track of when you start a task and how long it takes to do that task. It currently only lets you track one task at a time and everything is saved in the browser `sessionStorage()` so you can leave and come back.

This app is built with Gatsby and hosted on netlify and can be [found here](https://serene-shirley-df39f3.netlify.com/)

### Usage
```
npm i && npm start
```

### Wishlist
- better form validation
- better styling
- ability to clear out activity/tasks
- run multiple tasks at once
- leaving session and coming back from session resets the timer.

Got up and running with [gastby-starter-project](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)
